				There are many reasons your beard may become thin. You may even lose your beard completely if you are affected by certain conditions. Many of these conditions cause only temporary loss of facial hair; others may cause permanent loss, but these are confined to small parts of your beard.</p>
                <h4>The Natural Cycle of Facial Hair</h4>
			<p>All hair goes through a growth cycle---even beard hair. When a strand of hair enters the end of its telogen phase, which is also known as the rest phase, it falls out and the follicle begins growing a new hair in its place. As a result of your hair's life cycle, it is natural to lose between 50 and 100 hairs per day from your beard, scalp and other parts of your body.</p>
            <h4>Illness</h4>
            <p>
                Telogen effluvium is a condition in which your hairs enter their telogen phase early. This causes your hair to be shed at a faster rate and can affect the thickness and fullness of your beard as well as the hair on your head. You will notice a gradual thinning across your entire beard and scalp due to this condition. It can have a number of causes, including infections, high fever, major surgeries or influenza. Chronic illnesses that can cause beard loss include thyroid disease and low protein or serum iron. The American Academy of Dermatology notes that this type of hair loss is temporary in most cases and your beard will gradually return after the contributing factor has been removed.
            </p>
            <h4>Damaged Skin or Hair</h4>
			<p>
			Physical damage to the skin on your face can cause the permanent death of hair follicles. If your skin becomes scarred, hair will not typically grow on the scar tissue. Chemical treatments, which are a common cause of hair damage on the scalp, are not as common among the causes of beard hair loss, but excessive coloring of your beard hair can result in damaged hair.</p>
			
            <h4>ARE THE HAIRS IN MY BRUSH OR COMB NORMAL?</h4>
            <p>
			You could drive yourself crazy trying to keep track of the number of hairs that either fall out naturally during the course of your day or what comes loose during the maintenance of your beard, but as I said at the start losing some hair is completely natural and nothing to worry about. Maybe your beard is getting rather long and you feel more hairs are coming out than before? Again, don’t worry, longer hairs are more noticeable when they fall out or accumulate on your brush, that doesn’t necessarily mean you’re losing more hairs, just longer ones. If you would like a simple test to check your hair loss level, try to get roughly 60 or so hairs in between your thumb and a finger, lightly pull as you run through the length of the hairs. According to Dr. James C. Marotta (a New York based hair restoration specialist) anything up to 5-8 hairs pulled free would be considered normal, whereas an excess of 15 could indicate something other than the normal life cycle of the hair could be the cause of the hair loss.
			</p>
            <h4>SO I SHOULDN’T BE FREAKING OUT?</h4>
            <p>While I can’t speak to every case, I can say that the loss of hairs is completely normal, natural, and healthy. These can fall out during brushing, washing, oiling, or just walking around. To minimize hair loss, include an effective conditioner such as beard oil or beard dry oil (beard balm) into your routine and make sure that you are grooming your beard with a high quality comb or brush. I hope this information has helped put you at ease concerning the hairs you see in the shower, sink, floor, or brush.  Stress can also be a contributing factor to hair loss so take what comfort you can in this article, as we certainly don’t want you to lose any more than will naturally fall out on their own!  </p>
