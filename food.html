				Since facial hair growth is almost completely regulated by male hormones (testosterone and DHT), eating foods that increase the levels of these two hormones, and increase the bodily utilization of these so called androgens, is the real way to stimulate facial hair growth naturally.</p>
                <p>In short, the best beard growth foods do the following;
			<ol>
			<li><p>1.	Increase natural thyroid hormone production.</p></li>
			<li><p>2.	Increase testosterone and DHT levels naturally.</p></li>
			<li><p>3.	Lower the carrier protein SHBG, making testosterone and DHT more active.</p></li>
			<li><p>4.	Contain the necessary beard vitamins and minerals to stimulate growth.</p></li>
			</ol>
			</p>
                <h4>Egg</h4>
               <p>Eggs are very high in quality protein which is one of the essential building blocks of hair.</p> 
                <p>Eggs also contain cholesterol – which although demonized – is necessary for healthy testosterone production, the hormone necessary for beard growth.</p>
                <p>One of the main vitamins for beard growth is biotin, and it just so happens that eggs are one of the richest sources of biotin.</p>
                <p>Last but not least, eggs are loaded with nearly all essential micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and also have fairly good fatty-acid ratios for production of testosterone and DHT (high in saturated and monounsaturated fats, low in polyunsaturated).</p>
                
                <h4>Orange Juice</h4>
			<p>Orange juice might not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about foods that promote beard growth, but this doesn’t mean it wouldn’t work.</p>
            <p>The reason why OJ is a beard boosting food is that it’s high in the fruit sugar fructose. And fructose has been shown to lower the amounts of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is a hormone that binds testosterone and DHT, making them less active in the body.</p>
            <p>When you drink orange juice the naturally occurring fructose in oranges will lower SHBG release from the liver, and thus leave more free-testosterone and free-DHT into the bloodstream to attach to hair follicles and make them grow thicker and stronger.</p>
            <p>Not only is OJ beneficial for male hormones, it also increases thyroid activity, which can speed up beard, nail, and hair growth. Not to mention the naturally occurring vitamin C that is necessary micronutrient for facial hair growth.</p>

            <h4>Potatoes</h4>
            <p>
               Potatoes are a clean and gluten free source of quality carbohydrates. </p>
               <p>And carbohydrates are what your body needs in good amounts to produce testosterone, as well as DHT (the main hormone behind facial hair growth).</p>
               <p>One study showed that when people eat twice as much calories from carbs than from protein (a protein to carb ratio of 1:2), their testosterone and DHT levels shoot up.</p>
               <p>Needless to say that this makes potatoes a food that helps grow facial hair naturally.</p>

            <h4>Gelatin</h4>
			<p>
			Our ancestors always ate the full animal when they hunted. This gave them the muscle-meat, the connective tissue protein, and the internal organ nutrients.
            <p>
			Fast forward to today, and we only consume the muscle-meat. This gives us an unbalanced intake of amino acids (protein building blocks).
            </p>
            <p>We get too little of two of the main amino acids for hair and beard growth, which are; glycine and proline. These are the actual collagen proteins that your body uses to produce hair, skin, and nails. And the fact that we lack them in our diets slows down our natural beard growth abilities.</p>
            <p>I get that it’s not that enjoyable to start eating animal organs and bone cartiledge, but let me tell you that there’s also an easier way to get more glycine and proline Gelatin. The tasteless powder used in making jelly. Nearly half of the amino acids in gelatin are collagen proteins, and thus this food stimulates facial hair growth.</p>

            <h4>Brazil Nuts</h4>
            <p>Brazil nutsbrazil nuts beard in my food are one of the best foods that help grow facial hair.</p>
            <p>This is because of the very high amount of the mineral selenium in them.

In fact, 100 grams of Brazil nuts contains 1917mcg’s of selenium (2739% of RDA).</p>
            <p>Meaning that as little as 2 of these bad-boys per day can speed up beard growth naturally, as selenium increases testosterone, is necessary mineral for beard growth, and speeds up thyroid function.</p>

            <h4>Raisins</h4>
            <p>Raisins might be the big secret for fixing patchy beard. Seriously.</p>
            <p>This is because they’re among the highest natural sources of boron, a trace mineral great for beard growth, that not many men know about.

And boron, it increases DHT levels and free testosterone.</p>
            <p>One study showed a nice 28% increase in testosterone and 10% boost in DHT with only 10mg’s of boron per day. And another one saw similar results with slightly lower boron dosage.

Good thing is that 100 grams of raisins contains 3mg’s of boron, making them one of the best and not so well-known beard foods.</p>

            <h4>Beef</h4>
            <p>Meat is really good for testosterone production and therefore also beard growth.</p>
            <p>Red meat for example is a great source of saturated fat, the main fatty-acid needed for testosterone synthesis.

It’s also rich in quality animal protein, helping your body to naturally maintain the building material for hair growth.</p>

            <h4>Sorghum</h4>
            <p>Sorghum is a relatively unknown gluten-free grain.</p>
            <p>It’s also one of the unknown foods that help promote beard growth.</p>
            <p>Sorghum has been scientifically proven to increase the levels of 5-a reductase enzyme by 54% And 5-a enzyme converts testosterone into DHT, the more potent beard growing hormone.</p>
